# Android-Projects
In this repository is possible to find some of my Android projects made with Android Studio

I made those two projects during my last year of highschool to have a first touch with the Android world and to practice my Java skils.

Ortodromia Solver is an app that helps solving problems concering Science of Navigation.
It was my first Android app and the goal of that project was just to get something working on the smartphone... 
There are some problems with the outputs, I wouldn't suggest to use it to solve anything at this moment. 
I still consider this project a success since I still got a basic interface of input and elaborated an output in my first app.

Tic Tac Toe is the Android app of my java program Tic Tac Toe, 
Here I implemented the 1vs1 mode and I had some fun implementing the music and the backgroind color in the settings.
